    "## Problem 3: Read before you buy!\n",
    "\n",
    "![zillow](zillow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a dataset of single family houses sold in Connecticut near the beginning of 2021, collected from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/homes/connecticut_rb/). You will build linear models of the price at which each house sold for, based on its characteristics listed in the real estate listing. Such characteristics include internal square footage, the year it was built, the bedroom count, the bathroom count, and the area of the lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is also usually a lengthy description written by the real estate agent. Is there any additional information hidden in such a description that would help improve the model of the price? This is the question we focus on in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering such a question is difficult because the description is written in natural language with thousands of different words. Here we use topic models as a dimension reduction technique. Specifically, instead of using thousands of possible words, and how many times they show up in each house description, we reduce the words to the topic proportions $\\theta_d$ for each document, obtained by posterior inference. These proportions are combined with the other quantitative variables in a linear model with the logarithm of the house price as the response variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledgment: The data were scraped and the analysis was done by [Parker Holzer](https://parkerholzer.github.io/), as he began his search for a new house for his family after beginning a job as a data scientist. Thanks Parker!\n"
